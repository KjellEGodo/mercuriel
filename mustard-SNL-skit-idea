something about a for profit prison administrator   trying to pump up the prison terms to keep all the prison 
sockets filled to keep bodies installed in all the prison cells in the prisons   to keep the lights on in the 
prisons if SNL could make a skit wherein something like the voice delivery of john belushi when he said  they 
took the bar  in Animal House could be used to say something like  they got mustard on me   and then with the 
lip curdling maybe momentary sneer in abject carol burnet show scene chewing horror   i smelled    mustard
i don't know how i am going to go on my life is ruined ruined    therefore i think he should get life <------[ suddenly a psychopathic change to composed and impatient ]
life in prison for that perp is the only justice that will get me that closure which might enable
me to heal and    ultimately   ultimatelyaye   carry on and rejoin society as no
longer            a suicide risk               so help you     the judge
